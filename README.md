# Testing-Cucumber-Java-BDD-TDD-Automation
Learning QA Automation using Cucumber Selenium Java by testing saucedemo.com website

This is direct sequel of this repo:
```
https://github.com/afanse3/SeleniumTest
```
How to run
1. First you need to install Java SDK 19 version, dont' use SDK 20 because Selenium still (as of my commit) doesn't support it so it will give an error. Then install Intellij IDE.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open this file using Intellij IDE.
4. Install depedencies in the maven pom.xml.
5. Open src/test/java/runner/RunTest.java (for BDD) or src/test/java/runner/RunTestTdd.java (for TDD).
6. Run with debugger using Intellij.
7. You'll see in folder target/RegressionReport.html or target/RegressionReportTdd.html to see if the test is succeed or failed.
